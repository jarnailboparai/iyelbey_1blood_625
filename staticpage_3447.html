J. J. Jammeh has dreamed and talked of our country becoming self-sufficient in rice, eliminating the need for imported rice to feed our population. &nbsp;His clarion call for Gambians to go back to the farm so we can “eat what we grow and grow what we eat”, has inspired a national desire and determination for agricultural independence. &nbsp;To this end, we must commend His Excellency The President, Ambassador Ansumana Jammeh, Ambassador Momodou Seedy Kah, and Omar N. S. F.

Africa region interventions are his operations in Sierra Leone from 1999 to 2010 where he ultimately developed 575 farms totaling over 250,000 acres and a 6.5 Million Bushel 2010 harvest in Sierra Leone – all without the use of synthetic fertilizers, from what started with 3-1/2 ounces of wild-harvested seed rice in 1999. &nbsp;This was accomplished without support from any other entity. He gave the 575 farms together with $84 Million USD on rice back to the respective communities 15 years ahead of the contracted time, in preparation to relocating to another ECOWAS country to continue their training and intervention success. &nbsp;In Liberia, he trained 1,500 ex-combatants in Bong County, and transformed over 3,500 acres of raw bush to developed rice farms in pre-harvest condition in just 5 months in 2009; proving that his Swamp-2-Rice Quick Impact, could enable the nations of W. Africa to reach their 2015 food capacity goals in 2-3 years, if there was the national commitment and political will to do so. The intervention also transformed Bong County from the “most dangerous county in the country”, to the safest county, which hosted the 2009 World Food Day. &nbsp;During Liberia’s 2009 Independence Celebration, 1BLOOD farms were prime stops on the National Tour, and Bong County was declared the “safest county in the country” and the “Bread Basket” of the country!</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Hon.

He is now in the process of bringing several experts he has trained in the 1BLOOD Rice Production System to Gambia; supervise the implementation of their rice production system, and to pass on the training and technology to Gambians, so the success demonstrated in other countries will be replicated on Gambian soil.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>When asked what he hoped to accomplish here in The Gambia, His Response was: “Talk is Cheap!

He explained that any valid discussion of the concept of Food Security is futile, without both defining it and the pre-requisite steps to making it a reality. His explanation began with some concepts and data I had never heard of, or read in all my research on the subject. Following is some excerpts from his detailed exposition.</div><div>“First of all”, he said, “since the U.N. 2015 National Millennium Development Extreme Hunger Elimination Goal is 1.5 cups of food rice, per person, per day, meeting this objective is actually achieving “food capacity”. “Food Sufficiency” is food capacity, plus sufficient rice stored to feed the national population for 3-years. &nbsp;“Food Security” is food capacity, plus sufficient rice stored to feed the national population for 7-years. &nbsp;When this is achieved, food availability and affordability is secure against weather, climate or other disruptive food production events. &nbsp;This being understood, 1.5 cups per day, times the national population, times 365 days per year, times 3 bushels of seed rice for each bag of food rice equals the volume of nationally-grown seed rice required to meet national food capacity. &nbsp;In other words, if we assume a national population of 2 million, the food production required to feed the nation for 1-year is:</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><div>2 Million population</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Multiplied by: 1.5 cups per person/per day = 3 Million cups per day;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Multiplied by: 365.25 days per year = 1,095,750,000 cups per year</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Divided by: 82.5 cups per 50kg bag = 13,281,818 50kg bags of food rice</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Multiplied by: 3 bags of seed rice per bag of food rice = 39,845,455 bags of seed rice</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Divided by: 20 bags of seed rice per long ton = 1,992,278.8 tons of seed rice</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Multiplied by: 40 bushels of seed rice per ton of seed rice</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Equals: 79,691,152 bushels of seed rice must be grown to feed our national population for 1 year.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Therefore, maximizing the yield per acre becomes a critical component in our national independent food capacity goal. &nbsp;The application technology is key to our national success. Our prayer and hope is that the national obstruction, embarrassment, false reports &amp; slander, etc., which has disappointed and frustrated our zealous efforts to bring and activate many joint-venture and development partners for the last 2 years, will not also block and obstruct our efforts to attract international rice development partners. &nbsp;Our commitment is not deterred.
